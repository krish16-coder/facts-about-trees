            <p>Trees. They offer shade on a summerâ€™s day. Stunning bursts of colour in fall. The stark beauty of bark against an overcast winter sky. And the hope of rebirth as green leaf shoots sprouts from seemingly out of nowhere in spring. Trees are not only pretty to look at; they are vital to the existence of life. Trees produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, offer a home for teeming communities of wildlife, provide us with timber for making an infinite number of products, and are in general, absolutely incredible. Living beings, large to small, require plants because they eat them and live in them.</p>
